# About This Repository 

This repository holds [WARC](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000236.shtml) files and scraped directories of archived project sites, created using the [wget](https://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Wget_with_WARC_output) commmand-line tool.

## Why Does This Exist?

For historical purposes and otherwise, it is sometimes useful to reference old sites worked on by the [Inclusive Design Research Centre](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/) and its partners in the [Inclusive Design Institute](https://inclusivedesign.ca/).

This repository attempts to preserve only the public-facing content of the sites - content that was behind a login or similar is not preserved by this method.
